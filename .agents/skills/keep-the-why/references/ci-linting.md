# CI linting setup

How the project init wizard (see `setup.md`) wires `keep-the-why-lint` into a project's CI, and optionally into pre-commit. The linter validates the *structure* of `.keep-the-why` and the context directory — required fields, valid values, index consistency, hidden-content red flags — gated by the project's `context-schema`. It never judges content; that stays a human call. Consumer-facing documentation, the version scheme, and every finding code: https://keepthewhy.com/linting/

## Detect, don't assume

Decide what to offer from what the repository actually shows — the same rule as `autostart.md`: don't invent or fake a mechanism for a platform the evidence doesn't support.

| Evidence | Offer |
|---|---|
| `.github/` directory exists, or the `origin` remote host is `github.com` | GitHub Actions workflow |
| `.gitlab-ci.yml` exists, or the `origin` remote host contains `gitlab` | GitLab CI job |
| Another CI's config is recognizable (Jenkinsfile, `.circleci/`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `.woodpecker.yml`, ...) | The generic `pip` snippet, shown — not written: don't author config for a CI whose format can't be verified here |
| No CI evidence at all | Nothing to write; mention the generic snippet once in case CI comes later |
| `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists | Also offer the pre-commit hook |
| No `.pre-commit-config.yaml` | Don't offer pre-commit — introducing a new tool into a project that doesn't use it isn't setup, it's a separate decision |

Before writing anything, check that nothing equivalent already exists (a workflow or job that already runs `ktw-lint`, or references `keep-the-why`) — if it does, say so and skip; don't add a second copy.

## What gets written

- **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ktw-lint.yml`, the snippet below verbatim. The root of the `keep-the-why` repository is a composite action that installs the linter its own ref belongs to, referenced via the moving `lint-latest` tag — which follows linter publishes, not skill releases (the skill's own `latest` tag doesn't carry the action until the next skill release) — so the consumer never pins anything and gets the newest linter. A project that wants a fixed version uses the matching `lint-v<version>` tag (or its commit SHA) instead, which pins action and linter together; the `version` input is only for mixing the two (a pinned ref with a rolling linter, or the reverse).
- **GitLab CI:** the `ktw-lint` job below, appended to `.gitlab-ci.yml`. If the file defines `stages:`, give the job a `stage:` from that list (`test` if present, otherwise ask which) — a job without a stage falls back to `test`, which fails the pipeline when custom stages don't include it. If there's no `.gitlab-ci.yml` at all but the remote is GitLab, creating one with only this job makes it the project's first pipeline — say that plainly before doing it.
- **pre-commit:** the hook below, added under an existing `repo: local` entry if there is one, otherwise as a new one. The keep-the-why repository root is not a Python package, so the hook pulls the linter from PyPI via `additional_dependencies` rather than pointing `repo:` at the skill repository.
- `strict: "false"` / no `--strict` by default: warnings (a missing `Type` on an old entry, a missing guard file) are "next time touched" material per the skill's own rules and shouldn't block a fresh project's CI. Mention that `--strict` exists.

None of this is committed by the wizard — same as every other file setup writes (rule 7): staged in the working tree, committed when the user says so.

<!-- snippets:start -->
**GitHub Actions** — `.github/workflows/ktw-lint.yml`:

```yaml
name: ktw-lint

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  ktw-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oliver-zehentleitner/keep-the-why@lint-latest   # rolling; @lint-v<version> pins action and linter together
        with:
          path: "."
          strict: "false"    # "true" turns warnings (e.g. missing Type on old entries) into failures
          # version: "latest"     # only to mix: a pinned ref with a rolling linter, or vice versa — https://keepthewhy.com/linting/#versions-and-pinning
```

**GitLab CI** — job for `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
ktw-lint:
  image: python:3.12
  script:
    - pip install keep-the-why-lint
    - ktw-lint .
```

**pre-commit** — hook for `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: ktw-lint
        name: keep-the-why-lint
        entry: ktw-lint .
        language: python
        additional_dependencies: ["keep-the-why-lint"]
        pass_filenames: false
```

**Any other CI, or locally:**

```sh
pip install keep-the-why-lint
ktw-lint .            # exit 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage error
ktw-lint . --strict   # warnings fail too
ktw-lint . --setup    # locally only: also ~/.keep-the-why/<id>.md and ~/.keep-the-why/config
```

## The dashboard export

Offered by the project wizard when a docs build exists (a GitHub Pages workflow, `mkdocs.yml`, a `docs/` deploy job), never invented where none does. One step in that build, after the site is generated and before it is uploaded — `keep-the-why-dashboard` reads the checkout and writes three static files, no server, no external request:

```yaml
      # Keep the Why: the project's own dashboard on /dashboard/live/ — index.html,
      # state.json and the live badges (badge-entries.svg, badge-entries-flat.svg),
      # exported from this checkout. Needs the full
      # history (fetch-depth: 0 on the checkout step) to date entries by commit.
      - run: |
          pip install --quiet keep-the-why-dashboard
          ktw-dashboard --export site/dashboard/live .
```

`site/` is whatever directory the build uploads (`site/` for MkDocs, `_site/` for Jekyll, `build/` for Sphinx — match the project's own). `--anonymize` replaces Git author names with `author-1`, `author-2`, … for a repository whose contributors did not ask to be listed on a web page. The live badge in the README then points at the project's own export:

```markdown
[![Keep the Why · live](https://example.org/dashboard/live/badge-entries.svg)](https://example.org/dashboard/live/)
```

with the site's real URL, and `dashboard-state: https://example.org/dashboard/live/state.json` in `.keep-the-why` — the line another dashboard reads, in its *public* mode, to show this project's export in place of a checkout (the family web across repositories, `docs/dashboard.md`). `badge-entries.svg` is rendered at export time with the project's numbers (and `badge-entries-flat.svg` shows the same in the flat style badge services draw) ("42 entries · 3 open" — open, needs-review and pending-confirmation count as open), so README → the project's own SVG → the project's own dashboard, and no badge service in between. Staged, not committed, like everything else setup writes.

## The local run is a different setting

CI checks everyone's entries after the push, on a runner with no home files. The same linter run locally, after each write and — with `--setup` — over the developer's own two home files, is the personal `local-lint` setting: asked by the personal wizard, not the project one, because installing and running a tool is a per-developer, per-machine choice. Everything about it — when it runs, the version floor, how it gets installed, what to do with findings — is "Local linting" in `setup.md`.

## Adding it to an existing project later

Nothing about this is tied to first-time setup: a project that declined, or was set up before the linter existed, adds the same files by hand or by asking the agent to — the detection table above applies just the same. There's no config field recording whether linting is set up; the workflow file's presence *is* the state.
