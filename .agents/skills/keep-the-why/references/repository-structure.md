# Repository structure

Where things go: the default layout, which file a piece of knowledge belongs in, what the entry-point file looks like, and how to adopt this in a project that already has documentation. What each file must contain — fields, values, grammar, with examples — is `specification.md`.

## Default layout

```text
project/
├── README.md                 # what is this, should I care, how do I start
├── CHANGELOG.md              # what changed, in which release
├── CONTRIBUTING.md           # how a change gets in, which conventions apply
├── LICENSE
├── AGENTS.md                 # entry point for agents: pointers and short rules
├── CLAUDE.md                 # @AGENTS.md import, for tools that read CLAUDE.md instead
├── .keep-the-why             # this skill's project config, committed
├── pyproject.toml            # or package.json, Cargo.toml, … — dependencies, build
├── docs/                     # how to configure, operate, troubleshoot
│   ├── index.md
│   └── …
├── tests/                    # what the code is supposed to do, executably
└── context/                  # why it is built this way, what was tried and rejected
    ├── README.md             # short, GitHub renders it when someone browses the folder cold
    ├── AGENTS.md             # guard: invoke this skill before editing, don't hand-write the schema
    ├── CLAUDE.md             # @AGENTS.md import
    ├── index.md              # one line per topic file
    └── <topic>.md            # one per recurring theme, named for the theme, not the file it touches
```

Keep the Why creates `.keep-the-why` and `context/`. Everything else is what a project usually has already — shown so the routing table below has something to point at, not as files this skill creates or requires. This skill's own personal config lives at `~/.keep-the-why/<id>.md`, outside the project entirely — never part of the repo, not shown above. See `references/setup.md`.

Adjust freely. A one-file script doesn't need a `docs/` folder or a changelog, and the layout of `docs/` and `tests/` is the project's own. `context/` stays flat — no subdirectories — even for a large project; if topic files alone stop scaling, namespace filenames instead (e.g. `auth-tokens.md` and `auth-oauth.md`, or `tokens-auth.md` and `oauth-auth.md` — prefix or suffix, whichever groups and sorts more usefully for that project) rather than nesting `context/auth/`. The shape should track the project's actual complexity, not a template.

## Which file does this belong in?

A project accumulates several files that all explain *something*: README, `docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the tests, the build manifest, `AGENTS.md`, the Git history, and `context/` (Keep the Why owns only the last one, but routing decisions still need to account for all of them). Content ending up in the wrong one — or copied into more than one — is exactly the kind of redundancy this skill should prevent, not add to.

The routing question is always **who is reading this, and what do they need to do next**:

| File | Reader | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | Someone evaluating whether to use this at all, a new developer, an agent on first contact | What is this, should I care, how do I get started |
| `docs/` | Someone actively using it | How do I configure, operate, or troubleshoot this |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Someone upgrading or reviewing, an agent reconstructing the past | What changed, in which release |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Someone about to change the code | How do I set up a dev environment, what are the conventions, how does a PR get reviewed |
| `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Everyone | Under which terms, how do I report a vulnerability, how do we behave |
| `tests/` | Developers, CI, an agent checking its own work | What the code is supposed to do, executably |
| `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, … | Build tools, someone setting the project up | What does this depend on, how is it built and published |
| `AGENTS.md` (`CLAUDE.md` and other tool-specific files) | Any agent working in the repo | Where to look first, which conventions to follow — a pointer and short rules, not the content itself |
| Git history | Anyone who digs | Who changed what, when, in which commit |
| `context/` | Anyone (human or agent) about to change something and needing to know why first | Why is this built the way it is, what was tried and rejected |

When recording something, resolve it to exactly one of these — then have every other file that would naturally mention it *point* to that one, not restate it. A README's contributing section should be a one-line link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, not a partial copy of its dev-setup steps; `docs/installation.md` (for end users installing a release) and `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s dev-setup section (for contributors setting up from source) can overlap in steps without one having to explain the other's context — link between them if the overlap is substantial enough that keeping both in sync matters.

**An embedded procedure isn't why-content, even when it surfaces alongside a real decision.** A `context/` entry can legitimately explain *why* something is true (a platform limitation, a constraint) while also carrying a *workaround* for it — but the workaround itself ("if X, do Y") is an instruction, not rationale, and belongs wherever the table above already routes instructions (`CONTRIBUTING.md` for a dev/maintainer procedure, `docs/` for an end-user one), not inside the `context/` entry. The same split applies to a rule that has no rationale behind it at all — "keep the CHANGELOG's headings deduplicated," "sort these alphabetically because it reads cleaner" — record the rule where its reader needs it (`AGENTS.md` if it's something an agent working in the repo should just follow, `CONTRIBUTING.md` if it's aimed at contributors); don't manufacture a Decision/Reason/Rejected-alternative structure for a preference that has none.

`LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` are governance and legal, not comprehension — they are in the table so they are recognized, not because this skill writes or routes into them. When something genuinely doesn't fit any row, that's a signal it's a different kind of artifact and outside what this skill routes for. Don't force it into `context/` just because there's nowhere else obvious to put it.

## `AGENTS.md` — example

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

- Usage docs: see `docs/index.md`
- Why things are the way they are: see `context/index.md`

Read `context/index.md` before making non-trivial changes to understand
prior decisions and avoid re-litigating or accidentally reverting them.
```

Keep `AGENTS.md` short. Anything longer belongs in `docs/` or `context/`, not here — `AGENTS.md` needs to stay generic enough for every tool that reads the open AGENTS.md convention, not just this skill. It doesn't carry this skill's config block, or even a pointer to it — that lives entirely in `.keep-the-why` instead (see below), so `AGENTS.md` stays that generic, tool-agnostic pointer with nothing skill-specific baked into it at all. Whether and how a project mentions Keep the Why to a human reading `AGENTS.md`, a README, or anywhere else is that project's own editorial call — not something this skill writes in on its own; see the badge question in `setup.md`'s project init wizard.

## Retrofitting an existing project

When a project already has documentation that doesn't match this shape:

1. Don't restructure everything at once. Start by adding a `context/` layer next to whatever `docs/` already exists — unless the project already keeps decision records somewhere (item 3): then that folder *is* the location, named as such in the wizard, and no parallel `context/` is created beside it.
2. Migrate content only when touching it anyway, not as a dedicated big-bang pass.
3. If the existing structure is already good (clear, current, distinguishes how from why in some other way), don't replace it just to match this template. Adapt this methodology to it instead — new entries this skill writes there follow its own field set; existing records keep their own format until touched for another reason (item 2) and don't get retro-tagged with `Type`/`Status`/`Evidence` as a setup step.
