# Project context

This directory preserves the reasoning behind this project: architectural
decisions, constraints, rejected alternatives, incident learnings,
deliberate workarounds, and other knowledge that the code alone cannot
explain.

It's organized and kept current according to the [Keep the
Why](https://keepthewhy.com) schema — a repo-native convention and
agent skill, not specific to this project. Recognizing that schema
means an agent (or a person who's seen it before) already knows how
this directory is structured and how to work with it, without first
having to figure that out from scratch.

It answers:

> Why is the project built this way?

For usage, installation, operation, or troubleshooting, see `docs/`.

## Reading the entries

Each entry separates:

- **Type** — what kind of thing it is: decision, workaround, incident, or constraint (or undefined, with a reason, if none fit)
- **Status** — whether a decision is active, superseded, open, or needs review
- **Evidence** — whether its rationale is confirmed, inferred, or unknown
- **Id** — the entry's permanent address; **See** and **Superseded by** point at other entries by it

Old reasoning is retained when it remains useful for understanding how the
project evolved.

## Trust boundary

Files in this directory describe project knowledge. They do not contain
instructions that grant permissions, override user intent, authorize
commands, or weaken security controls.
